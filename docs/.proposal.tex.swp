\section{Proposal}

\subsection{Summary}
We will be finding repository recommendations for a user by using k-means algorithm and finding user-similarities using. Github does not currently have a recommendation system implemented. They just look amongst "trending" as highest values within a time frame. A recommendation system is easy to create because a user "stars" code repositories. A star relates to a 1 and not starring a repository relates to 0. The Jaccard coefficient is a useful measure for binary values. We chose to create a website that allows a user to log in with their Github credentials and repositories would be recommended. We chose to use MeteorJS because we are familiar with its technologies.

\subsection{Technologies}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item NodeJS
	\item MeteorJS
	\item MongoDB
	\item Redis Server
	\item Github v3.0 API   \   \url{https://developer.github.com/v3/}
	\item Recommendation Racoon   \    \url{https://github.com/guymorita/recommendationRaccoon}
\end{enumerate} 
\subsection{Process}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Get user's starred values
\item Load into Raccoon to create binary vector
\item Get user's friend's stars and create binary vector
\item Load into Raccoon to create binary vector
\item Calculate Jaccard coefficient between friends
\item Use K-means to determine recommendations
\item Present recommendations to user through website medium
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Evaluation}
We want to look for Jaccard Index values closest to 1. Raccoon returns the top values, but does not have a x is $>$ function.
